PA1473 – Software Development 

Introduction:
We have during this course worked on a EV3 Mindstorm robot, to accomplish certain user stories that were given by our customer throughout the course. 

Getting started: 
Download Visual Studio Code and download the extensions so you can write Python and connect it to a EV3 Lego Mindstorms Robot. Connect the robot to your computer using a USB-wire. Thereafter you need to connect the device within Visual Studio Code under EV3DEV Device Browser. 

Building and running:
To make the program run, you need to press the button “Download and run”. Thereafter, the whole starting menu is on the EV3 Device, so you need to press buttons to make the robot starts. However, if you want to adjust the pickup positions, you need to change it in the code. 
Features
US01: The robot shall be able to identify the targeted objects, identify the area the package is in so it’s the designated position, and then move to seize the package without damaging it. After being seized the package should be carried up in the air.

US09: The robot shall regularly check the pickup location for new items and be able to tell the user if a new item has arrived.

US10: The robot should be able to start sort items at a specific time and stop sort items at a specific time.

US11: The robot shall be able to communicate with another robot to simultaneously move packages without colliding. 

US12: The operator shall be able to manually set the location and heights of one pick-up zone and two drop-off zones.

US13: The pickup and drop-off positioning of the robot will be able to be adjusted easily by the user.

US14: The pickup task of the robot will be able to follow a set schedule set by the user.

US15: The robot will have an emergency stop-button for emergencies that safely terminates the movement without injuring the package.

US16: The robot will be able to pick up an item at point A, and within 5 seconds be able to safely drop it off at point B.

US17: the robot will be able to safely pick up items from a moving belt and put them down at a designated location based on color and shape.
